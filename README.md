# GNP-AutoDeploy
This is a collection of scripts that will deploy either Prometheus node_exporter, or grafana. Depending on what you would like to install.
Note: I will add a "master" script soon that will just install all three. its a wip
# Requirements
- Root/Sudo access
- SystemD
- curl
- A running prometheus instance (run deployment script if needed)
- Linux server with amd64 architecture 
# Node_Exporter will auto start after executing the script!
